# Overlook

## Abstract

For this project I was tasked with creating a webapp that will allow a user to book a night at a hotel. I used test driven development to implement and test various classes. I then had to fetch API data and allow a user to add a future booking which posted that data to the API and fetched the data again to remove that booking from available bookings. In the event there are any errors a message is displayed informing the user of an issue. 

## Project Goals and Objectives

- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
- Full project and rubric can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/overlook.html)

## Reflections


### Wins
- In this project I used fetch "DELETE" for the first time. Since I had never used it, I looked up ways to implement it and was able to delete a customers future booking and return that information to the available bookings. 
- Going into this project I was very nervous and intimidated however, as I began coding I was able to navigate through this project and create a successful UI and data model.

### Challenges
- A big challenge of this project was deciding how to set up my classes and test them. Going into this project without a formal comp to compare and plan off of left a lot of room for intrepretation.
- This project was my first project implementing test driven development on my own. I had to navigate through the test and verify my testing was complete with happy and sad paths.
